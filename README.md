This is pre-configured application for fast creation of new projects using [Kraken Framework](https://github.com/kraken-php/framework).

## Description

Kraken is the first and only multi-processed, multi-threaded, fault-tolerant framework for PHP. It has been written to 
provide easy and reliable API for creating distributed applications using PHP. Kraken aims to solve typical problems of 
writing such applications and to provide developers with powerful yet elegant tools for dealing with them. 

The main focus of Kraken Framework is put on: 
* __Concurrency__ : create systems that are asynchronous and concurrent by design,
* __Distribution__ : divide your application into several containers and run them on multiple threads, processors or hosts,
* __Faul tolerance__ : write systems that self-heal using remote and local supervision hierarchies,
* __Elasticity__ : modify existing architecture in realtime without need to change in code,
* __High performance__ : handle up to thousands of connections per second on each container,
* __Extensibility__ : use available options to easily extend and adapt framework features for your needs.

Start writing applications that were previously marked as impossible or hard to implement in PHP right know. Servers, 
service-oriented architecture, agent-based models, games, complex daemons, socket programs, schedulers and much, much 
more - nothing is impossible with Kraken! 

For more information go to [framework repository](https://github.com/kraken-php/framework) or [official website](http://kraken-php.com).
